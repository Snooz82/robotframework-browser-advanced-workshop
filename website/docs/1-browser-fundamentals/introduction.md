This chapter introduces the foundational concepts you need to work effectively with Robot Framework Browser (Playwright-based).

You’ll start with the overall architecture and installation model (Python library communicating with the Node/Playwright side), including practical notes about managing Python/Node environments. You’ll then learn how to get actionable diagnostics when things go wrong by using Robot Framework logging, Node-side logging, and Playwright traces.

Finally, you’ll connect these basics to Playwright’s core model—**Browser**, **Context**, and **Page**—and how Browser library scoping impacts stability, speed, and test isolation.
