# 3.4 Localization
Browser library supports localization for your language when needed.

Localization is handled by Browser,
[PythonLibcore](https://github.com/robotframework/PythonLibCore) (PLC)
and translation project
[robotframework-browser-translation](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser-translation)

The translation project is responsible for maintaining translation JSON files and
using the API defined by Browser library. If the library is imported with the `language`
argument and a match is found in the translation project, then the JSON file
is provided to PLC. PLC will look up translated keyword names and documentation
from the JSON file and provide translated objects to Robot Framework.

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library     Browser    language=FI

*** Test Cases ***

```

If you want to create translation for Browser library at your
preferred language, make a PR to the Browser library translation
project.

`rfbrowser translation` command line can create initial json file
structure for you. The command line can also check whether a new version of
Browser library requires updates to your translation JSON file.
