title: "3. Browser Advanced Keywords (Optional)"
sidebar_position: 1
---

This chapter collects advanced (and optional) topics that help you build more reliable, maintainable end-to-end tests.

You’ll explore Playwright-style waiting behavior and how Browser’s assertions retry by default, including how to tune timeouts and retries. You’ll also see how to call Browser keywords directly from a custom Python library, which is useful when you want to encapsulate flows as Python keywords.

Finally, you’ll cover localization-related considerations so your tests remain stable across languages, locales, and formatting differences.
