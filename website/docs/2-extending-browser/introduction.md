This chapter focuses on extending Robot Framework Browser beyond the built-in keywords.

You’ll learn how the **Python Plugin-API** lets you add new keywords (or replace existing ones) while reusing Browser’s internal connection to Playwright. You’ll also get a practical JavaScript refresher for writing small helper scripts and for understanding the Node-side execution model.

Finally, you’ll implement and debug a **JavaScript Plugin-API** module, including how to attach a Node debugger to the Browser/Playwright process when you need to step through your custom code.
